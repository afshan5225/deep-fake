# Deepfake Animation with First-Order Motion Model

This project generates a deepfake animation by applying motion from a driver video to a source image, using the **First-Order Motion Model** for image animation. This model allows you to create a realistic animation where a static image mimics the movements from a video.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - `pip install numpy`
- [Imageio](https://imageio.github.io/) - `pip install imageio`
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - `pip install matplotlib`
- [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) - `pip install scikit-image`
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) - Installation instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
